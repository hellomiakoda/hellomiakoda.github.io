# Getting This Ready

I've been journaling and trying to find an easy way to get it publicly available. This was a bit difficult to set up, and has some issues (such as being unable to change what socials are listed in about, in that nice list), but the fact that it takes no effort to write an entry and get it up automatically is what I was after. Journaling is difficult when you have serious executive function. I'm also working on a second journal for entries I don't want public while I'm alive, and a away for them to get copied over when I die. I want documentation of my life, dealing with my country falling to fascism. Bare with me while I get this sorted out. I'm not sure how to ensure entries are listed chronologically. I'm not sure what the workflow is using to decide the order. So far, it seems to be using the timestamp of when they're uploaded. That's a bit of an issue for existing entries. I guess if that's what it's doing, I can just upload them in order, and new entries will already happen in order. We'll see. I hope it doesn't reorder them if I have to make an edit to fix a typo. Perhaps the touch command will reorder them? Who knows? I guess I'll find out. Maybe I'll learn how to fork what I'm using and fix my version to better suit my needs for this journal.
