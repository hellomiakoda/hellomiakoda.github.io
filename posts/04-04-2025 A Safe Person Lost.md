# 04-04-2025 A Safe Person Lost

##### 	This week has been particularly horrible. The economy is in free fall as Trump throws huge tarrifs on every single country. He's so incompetant, he's issued tarrifs on imports from inhabited places like Anticartica. The government is also just disappearing people now. They show up in an unmarked vehicle, men in unmarked clothes hop out and grab someone, stuff them in the vehicle, and take them to who knows where without due process of any sort. They claim "illegal imigrants" aren't entitled to due process, however due process is how one would determine whether or not the person is indeed in the country illegally. There was a father of an autistic kid who, despite having legal protections to remain here in the country, was deported to El Salvador and put in a super prison known for inhumane conditions, torture, and human rights violations. The Trump regieme says this was an administrative error, yet refuses to do anything to bring this man back and reunite him with his children. If they can do this to imigrants, they can do this to anyone. All they would need to do is claim someone is here illegally. Without due process, how would a US citizen prove they are a US citizen?

##### 	I've also suffered a particularly painful personal loss this week. Tuesday morning, I got phone calls from the amily of a very close friend of mine, Sarah. They were frantically looking for her, as she had been missing all night. I wasn't too concerned, this isn't the first time Sarah has droppped off the radar for a bit. I figured she was spending time with her boyfriend. Then, several hours later, I got another phone call. They had found her body in a hotel room. It appears she comitted suicide via overdose. I've never handled death well, but this one is particularly difficult. Sarah was one of my only 2 safe people that I could see in person. She didn't cost me any social energy.

##### Sarah always did her best to make any diffuclt situation better. But... I can't seek solace from Sarah when it's Sarah's death I'm distraught over. I've never lost anyone in this catagory before.
