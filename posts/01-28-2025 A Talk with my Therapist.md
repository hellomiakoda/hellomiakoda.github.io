# 01-28-2025 A Talk With my Therapist

I talked to my therapist this week. I told her about how I'm terrified of
what's happening with the government, and that I don't hold hope for surviving
till Trump leaves office. I don't think he will without violence, and the
people with the weapons have bowed down to him. My therapist's response was,
"I've got nothing."

I can't imagine there is therapist training for fascist dictatorship take over
of their client's country. I'm thankful she was honest about having nothing she
could say to help me. One thing that always makes a crisis worse for me are
false platitudes of "It'll be ok". How would they know?! Many times it's *not*
ok, and will *never* *be* ok.

ICE is entering schools and kidnapping immigrant children. CHILDREN!

The Holocaust didn't start with gas chambers. I've been saying that for years
as I watched this building.

I desperately want to help, but I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty for
not knowing what I can do. I'll continue trying to figure it out. It's all so
much to process, and processing is not something I excel at when there is so
much.

I'm seeing reports that the Medicaid portals are down, and the funding has been
frozen. It looks like I may be losing what care I have very soon, as he's
ripping through social programs. I don't know what I'll do if I lose my
disability benefits. I'm not able to hold a job, and even if I could I'm unlikely to be hired
since Trump repealed the act that keeps employers from discriminating against
disabled people.
